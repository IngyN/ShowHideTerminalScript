                       Show/hide Terminal Script Service

****************************************************************************

My purpose was to create a script that would enable me to show/hide
and open (if not running) the Terminal.app on Mac OS X so that once the script
is installed, I can use a shortcut to run the script.
Supported/Tested OS X versions: OSX El Capitan, macOS Sierra

Installation:

- Clone the repository on your computer
- Double-click the script file once downloaded
- It should ask you if you would like to install the service, Select Install Service.

- Open System Preferences
- KeyBoard > Shortcuts
- In the Services part, you should find it at the bottom
- Select the "New Terminal" option and click to add the shortcut you want :)
